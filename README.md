This is a mark down file *italics* looks like this and **bold** like this.

## This is a heading 2

### This is a heading 3
Some text here.

Blank spaces are ignored.

To do lists use
	-1. Thing one
	-2. Thing two
		a. Thing 2a

<This is code>

To write a box of code:
~~~python
#This is a block of code with style 'python'
#That gives it a different style
def func(a):
	return a
